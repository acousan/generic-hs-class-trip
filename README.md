CT Bootstrap Concepts Project

This project is for Coding Temple, to ensure the understanding of bootstraps basics, utilities, forms and components. 
I decided to create a basic website for a highschool senior trip, using only HTML and Bootstrap.
Website requirements included a navbar, form, table, two images and two buttons.

As you will see, I wanted this website to be real and flow well. I added bonus content to make it seem like this was a real sign up page for seniors
to turn to in order to attend and get more information on their school trip.

All content is responsive and accounts for different screen sizes. 
The navbar has collapsing behavior to make smaller screen friendly and fits required standards. 
Bonus content included to make the page flow better and give a little of explanation as to why the page is asking for personal information.
Form content includes all project requirements and includes bonus content to give it more realistic feel.
Table content includes sample data to simulate real submissions and includes all other requirements.
Images tie in with theme and fit requirements. 
Two buttons on bottom also tie into sentior trip theme and fit requirements, one being hidden on smaller screens.
